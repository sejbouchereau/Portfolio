# Scraper
This project, developed during my internship, is a web scraper/crawler designed to efficiently extract meaningful information from the Centris website. As Canadaâ€™s primary real estate platform for buyers and sellers, Centris hosts extensive property listings, making this tool invaluable for data collection and analysis.
